<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I created a my portfolio to demonstrate my ability to create stunning sites and to also showcase my previous work. Before starting the site I created a simple wireframe so that I could put my designing skills to the test.

I learnt how to use several new animation libraries to bring my vision to life. Furthermore, I implemented a Netlify form for the first time, was able to make the site accessible and responsive to all screen sizes.

### Built With

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Figma](https://figma.com)
- HTML/CSS/JS

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Features

- Landing page with particle animations and text transitions
- Functional about me section
- Customisable colour themes
- Contact form which utilises Netlify forms
- Project list with swipeable scrolling
- Responsive to all screen sizes


<!-- ROADMAP -->

## React

- Implemented the use of React hooks throughout the project
- Utilised useEffect to close the navigation automatically after 15 seconds
- Was able to reduce the size of components by mapping through data exported from an addtional JS file 
- Leveraged external libraries to create the form and animation effects for the site
- Used useRef to navigate through the site seemlessly

<!-- Future Improvements -->
## Figma

Made a low fidelity wire frame on Figma to visualise the ideas I had for my website.
